    This function produces an iterator of topologically sorted dependency
    lists from a graph dictionary.

    This algorithm sorts by removing childless nodes first, adds them to a
    list which it will sort and yield, and removes references to the nodes
    which were removed from the remaining dependency in the graph dictionary.

    Each list that is yielded is, by definition, independent of the other
    items in that list, which means each list may be processed in any order
    (or in parallel).

    Parameters
    ----------
    graph_set
        A dependency graph dictionary, with names associated to the set of
        dependencies of a product.

    Returns
    -------
    iterator
        An iterator which produces lists of dependencies in a bottom-up
